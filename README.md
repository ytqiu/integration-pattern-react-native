#integration-pattern-react-native

it is not a boilerplate workspace for react-native! it is some kind of pattern when you want integrate react-native with your existing project.

i wanna the integration smoothly for all members in my team. this is the best way i figure out. if you has some better pattern, thanks for telling me.

the trival integration official document at [here]("https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/embedded-app-ios.html#content")

i have improved the following points:

1. you can just XCode Run without starting Debug Server mannually.
2. you can pay no attention to bundle RNComponents to iOS package.

so it is not complete to understand.
